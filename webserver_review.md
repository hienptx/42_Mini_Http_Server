# Web Server Code Review

## 1. Structure

### Strengths
* **Modular Design:**
  * Clear separation of concerns: Server, `Request`, Response, `Router`, and config management are in separate files.
  * Use of structs like ServerConfig, `RouteConfigFromConfigFile`, and ClientSession makes the codebase organized.
* **Config-Driven:**
  * Uses a config file (webserv.conf) for server and route definitions, supporting multiple servers, locations, and directives.
* **Extensible:**
  * Supports multiple server blocks, locations, CGI, and custom error pages.
  * Routing logic is flexible and can be extended for more features.

### Weaknesses
* **Manual Routing Logic:**
  * Route and server selection logic is somewhat manual and could be error-prone if not carefully maintained.
* **Error Handling:**
  * Some error handling is basic (e.g., returning 404 for many issues), and could be more granular.
* **Code Duplication:**
  * Some logic (e.g., path normalization, header parsing) may be repeated in multiple places.

## 2. Security

### Strengths
* **Request Validation:**
  * There is some validation for malformed requests and content length.
* **CGI Isolation:**
  * CGI scripts are run in separate processes, which is good for isolation.

### Weaknesses
* **Path Traversal:**
  * No clear evidence of protection against path traversal attacks (e.g., `../../etc/passwd`).
    * **Mitigation:** Always sanitize and validate requested paths.
* **CGI Security:**
  * No chroot/jail or privilege dropping for CGI scripts.
    * **Mitigation:** Run CGI scripts as a non-privileged user and restrict their access.
* **Input Validation:**
  * No explicit input validation or sanitization for form data or file uploads.
* **Directory Listing:**
  * Autoindex exposes all files in a directory, which could leak sensitive files if not carefully configured.
* **Error Messages:**
  * Error responses may leak server structure or configuration details.
* **No HTTPS:**
  * No support for TLS/SSL (HTTPS), so all data is sent in plaintext.
* **No Rate Limiting:**
  * No protection against brute-force or DoS attacks.

## 3. Performance

### Strengths
* **Non-blocking I/O:**
  * Uses poll() and non-blocking sockets for handling multiple clients.
* **CGI Handling:**
  * CGI is handled asynchronously, so the server can continue processing other requests.

### Weaknesses
* **Single-threaded:**
  * The server appears to be single-threaded, which limits scalability on multi-core systems.
* **CGI Overhead:**
  * Each CGI request spawns a new process, which is expensive compared to FastCGI or persistent application servers.
* **No Caching:**
  * No static file or response caching, so repeated requests always hit the disk or backend.
* **Large File Handling:**
  * No chunked transfer encoding or streaming for large files; may load entire files into memory.
* **No Keep-Alive:**
  * No explicit HTTP keep-alive support, which could reduce performance for clients making multiple requests.

## Summary Table

| Aspect | Strengths | Weaknesses / Risks |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Structure** | Modular, config-driven, extensible | Manual routing, some code duplication |
| **Security** | Some validation, CGI isolation | Path traversal, CGI risks, no HTTPS, no rate limiting |
| **Performance** | Non-blocking I/O, async CGI | Single-threaded, no caching, CGI overhead, no keep-alive |

## Recommendations

### Security
* Sanitize all file paths and user input.
* Restrict CGI script permissions and run as a non-privileged user.
* Consider disabling autoindex or restricting it to safe directories.
* Add HTTPS support for production use.
* Implement rate limiting and better error handling.

### Performance
* Consider multi-threading or using a thread pool.
* Implement caching for static files.
* Support HTTP keep-alive and chunked transfer encoding.
* Use FastCGI or a persistent backend for dynamic content.

### Structure
* Refactor repeated logic into utility functions.
* Add more granular error handling and logging.

## Overall Assessment

Your server is well-structured for a learning project or lightweight use, but would need significant enhancements for production use, especially regarding security and scalability.
